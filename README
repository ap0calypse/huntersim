1. What the hell is this?
########################################################

What you have just downloaded is a small simulation of a population 
consisting of herbivores and carnivores called huntersim. The simulation 
is far away from being perfect, so please don't bother me with stuff 
like "that's unrealistic" or "no way dude!", because I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT 
VERY REALISTIC!

I tried to keep it as _realistic_ as possible. There are still many 
unrealistic parts (eq. the diagonal movement). The simulated animals 
don't move diagonally. They can only move on the x and y axis.


2. Why did you do this?
########################################################

I was bored.


3. Prerequisites
########################################################

You'll need a operating system with a terminal and ncurses installed. 
Nearly every current Linux distribution should do the thing. The only 
thing you'll need to install is the Curses perl-module either from 
CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/~giraffed/Curses-1.27/Curses.pm) or you 
install it with the package manager of your choice (apt-get/yast/whatever). 


4. Features
########################################################

Hunting skills and escape skills are passed over to the "kids". The kid 
always gets the average value between the two parent animals. Talented hunters 
also get rewarded by obtaining some skill points. The same happens to talented 
herbivores which manage to escape. I know this is not really realistic, 
but it's not THAT far away from the real world.


5. Configuration
########################################################

Nearly everything can be tweaked by editing modules/Territory.pm. 
This is the module where all the values are defined. The default values 
should be quite reasonable, but tweak it for your needs where you want. 
Just read the comments to understand what the values stand for.


6. How to run
########################################################

maximize your terminal window

$ chmod 755 huntersim
$ ./huntersim

... lean back and watch ...


7. I don't like this behaviour of animal X, change it!
########################################################

I won't change anything for you. If you want something changed,
open the editor of your choice and do it yourself. If you think
your changes are reasonable and make sense, send a patch to me or 
drop me a line with your github account so I can add you to the
collaborators. After that you can simply upload your changes.


8. Bugs and known issues
########################################################

 - all the animals can only see and move on the x and y axis.

 - herbivores can't starve. That's because I assumed that grass and plants are
   available all the time. That's not really good and will most likely be implemented
   in future versions.

 - Curses is quite ugly .. I know ... I'm sorry ...

 - Depending on your architecture it is possible, that many animals need much cpu-time.
   You have to understand, that every animal is a separated object.

 - the animals aren't divided into 2 sexes, the simplest thing is to assume that they 
   are hermaphrodites


9. License stuff
########################################################

Because I don't think that anyone wants to use this in a proprietary 
product I give erveyone the "do whatever you want" - license. As long as I don't 
say anything different you can do whatever you want. Just tell me if you do.
